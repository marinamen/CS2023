## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Success Criteria

✩࿐  ⊹˚. ♡

1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger will connect to a realtime library that will update the value of Solana every time the program is initiated
5. The electronic ledger will include a description of the cryptocurrency's value that entails a description of the market so that even if the client has little to no knowledge, decisions such as buying and selling will be more informed

# Criteria C: Development

## Login System
My client requires a system to protect the private data. I thought about using a login system to accomplish this requirement using a if condition and the open command to work with a csv file. 

AS you can sere in the flow diagram in **Fig 1**, In th first line I am defining a function called try_login, this function has two inputs of type string, and the output is a boolean representing True if the
user logins correctly or false otherwise. This is saved in the variable success. Then in line two...this is your work.
```.py
def try_login(name:str, password:str)->bool:
    with open('user.csv',mode='r') as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    success = False
    for line in data:
        uname = line.split(',')[0]
        upass = line.split(',')[1].strip() #strip() removes \n
        if uname == name and upass == password:
            success = True
            break
    return success
