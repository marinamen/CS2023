*1.What worked well?*

The coding in general was really fun and that did work well, however it was the fact that I coudnt test my code due to not having a computer that let me have pycharm therefore loosing the two extra marks.

*2.What did not work well?*

I included alot of explanations that delved deeper into the how more than the what, I didn'specify WHY or WHAT are some things, like some authentication questions needed explanaing, also specify parameters further more.

*3.What is your goal for unit 2?*

My goals include, have all the extra work that is available to do and focus more on justifying my explanation ad choices more.

*4.How do you plan on achieving this goal?*

I plan on achieving thes by having my normal computer and being a bit more organised and comparative to the mark scheme
